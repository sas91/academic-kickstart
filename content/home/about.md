I am a doctoral candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.ece.jhu.edu/), working in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shinji Watanabe](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/shinji-watanabe/). I am currently working on robust speech recognition in far-field, multi-talker scenarios. I focus on improving ASR with front-end processing like speech denoising, speech dereverberation, source separation, and multi-source localization. I recently proposed a paradigm called [directional ASR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00091.pdf).
